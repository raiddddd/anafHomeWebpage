# anafHomeWebpage
I turned my ANAF web page design from Figma into code using a front-end framework: Angular.

Short project description: Last August, when I didn't know to code yet, I was learning Figma and Web Design, UI and UX. My first portofolio project was to redesign the currend ANAF web page. ANAF is the financial and fiscal institution of Romanian Government. As you may expect(as it happens with many governamental sites), it looks awfull, the experience on the site is not very good and the page itself is not intuitive.

The initial design was made in Figma, and now I did code it in HTML, CSS and JS using Angular as a tool. This is my first Angular project I do for my code portofolio.
I will continue with a resume of what I did, how I did it and I will evaluate my work based on some good practices and programming principles and how I implemented them.
